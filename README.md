- 👋 Hi, I’m @silverij (otherwise known as Joan Silverio).
- 👀 I’m interested in "everything Nozomi."
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many applications including YouTrack, Github, Vantage, and others.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making user guides easy for customers to understand and follow, helping write release notes, and closing defects.
- 📫 How to reach me: Slack, Zoom, Outlook, and Teams, among other methods (walkie talkie - kidding).
